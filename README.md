# Data-Analytics Project of Customer Churn Prediction
📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for subscription-based businesses. This project:

Cleans and preprocesses raw customer data.

Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

Engineers new features such as customer lifetime, average usage, and payment ratios.

Trains multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluates models using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC.

Exports churn predictions and cleaned data to Excel/CSV.
